# Green Wheels

Welcome to the Green Wheels project repository! This is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate the government's efforts in predicting and improving ecotourism. Our platform leverages machine learning algorithms and data engineering techniques to provide accurate predictions and actionable insights.<br/>Whether you're a government agency or an eco-conscious traveler, Green Wheels empowers you to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Full-Stack Web Application:**
  - Developed using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend.
  - Utilizes **MongoDB** as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Machine Learning Integration:**
  - Leverages multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
    - **Random Forest**
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
    - **Linear Regression**
  - These algorithms enable accurate predictions related to ecotourism trends and patterns.

- **Data Engineering Techniques:**
  - Implements dimensionality reduction techniques such as **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.
  - These techniques enhance data processing efficiency and improve model performance.

- **Role-Based Authentication:**
  - Ensures secure access control by implementing role-based authentication.
  - Different user roles (e.g., administrators, tourists, researchers) have specific permissions and views within the application.
